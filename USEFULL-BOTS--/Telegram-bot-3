ðŸ”¥ Good news, everyone!

We're constantly making small tweaks and adjustments in our Army of Bots, and we've accumulated enough changes to justify a full-fledged update announcement, so here we go! 

@download_it_bot
â€” We frequently received complaints that the bot only downloads 30 seconds of audio from Yandex.Music. The issue is that full tracks are only available to Yandex+ subscribers, and our bot doesn't have a subscription; even if we added one, we'd quickly get blocked. To circumvent this, we've implemented a small hack: the bot will accept Yandex.Music links but download the track from YouTube instead. It might make mistakes occasionally; if it does, feel free to contact our support team.
â€” We've also fine-tuned the logic for Deezer and Spotify, as finding the correct track on YouTube wasn't always successful. Why can't we download directly? Because everything is encrypted.
â€” We removed the increased traffic coefficient for the Rumble service.
â€” We've handled issues with problematic video previews; sometimes YouTube previews were lost or replaced with incorrect images.
â€” Fixed an error with the delay for the appearance of a paid plan. If it doesn't show up immediately, contact our group.
â€” YouTube has tightened its restrictions, so we slightly increased the number of attempts and added logic to fetch information about videos via mobile proxies as well.

@ChatPolyglotBot
â€” Added support for more than 35+ languages.
â€” Disabled web previews for bot replies as they looked odd when links were included in the messages.
â€” Fixed an issue with cleverly formatted messages, including Unicode and everything else.

@NudesRemoverBot
â€” Reduced the minimum matching threshold from 50% to 25%. As it turns out, some users need these precise values.

@voice_remover_bot
â€” It turns out the setting for selecting the number of split tracks wasn't working. We've fixed this, of course, and thank you for notifying us via support.

@mad_ai_bot
â€” Responses from ChatGPT are now properly formatted; it used to be quite awful.
