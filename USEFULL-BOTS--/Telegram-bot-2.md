ðŸ”¥ Good news, everyone!

The last couple of weeks have seen some instability with Telegram, and we've been quite busy stabilizing our bot army. I think many of you have noticed that we've successfully tackled this task, while also making numerous improvements and fixes to several bots. Now, let's dive into the details.

In addition to the previous news about our referral system: premium allocations in @AximoBot, @download_it_bot and @mad_ai_bot for invited users occur automatically every day. According to our logs, the system distributes dozens of premiums daily. In a couple of weeks, we will implement automatic interest accrual from purchases made by your referrals.

@download_it_bot / @InstantMediaBot
â€” After the latest Telegram update, almost all  files stopped uploading to the messenger's servers. However, they have been reliably uploaded to our servers. Therefore, we've added a direct file link in the bot's response. If you don't want to wait (or if you don't need the files in Telegram), you can download them directly from our server. Or if the system wasn't able to upload them to the messenger's cloud, you'll still be able to download them using a temporary link.
â€” Fixed several annoying quota calculation bugs and now predict the downloadable file size more accurately.
â€” Improved document handling: files now have correct names and extensions. This will please those who love downloading archives, programs, and eBooks.
â€” Fixed a logic bug where the bot sent incorrect descriptions or couldn't upload a file due to corrupted formatting.

@HypemeterBot
â€” Fixed errors in charts generation, which sometimes resulted in failures.

@ChatzillaBot
â€” Redesigned the control button logic.
â€” Fixed the event log where there was inaccurate data output.
â€” Added the ability to delete incoming messages in trigger settings.
â€” Completely reworked topic handling logic and added triggers for specific topics.
â€” And many minor fixes and improvements.
