ðŸ”¥ Good news, everyone!

Now the news section is available across our entire army of bots. Besides this, catch a batch of improvements for several bots at once.

After the announcement of our two bots, @NudesRemoverBot and @ChatPolyglotBot, we received a lot of comments and suggestions. We implemented most of them and also adjusted the behavior in some scenarios.

@NudesRemoverBot
â€” Added support for anonymous admin mode.
â€” The bot can now monitor animations (GIFs).
â€” Expanded the list of categories, adding a new category called "Sexy", which entails moderate erotic content. This will be useful if you want to protect your group from any unsafe graphics. Additionally, we added the option to choose which categories the bot should monitor and delete media if they match.
â€” Debug mode. Add the text "debug" to your message or in the description of a picture, and the bot will send you feedback regarding category compliance. This will help with debugging threshold values.

@ChatPolyglotBot
â€” Added support for anonymous admin mode.
â€” Polished translation visuals for a more concise appearance.
â€” The bot now ignores commands from other bots. Additionally, messages mentioning other bots will not be translated.
â€” The translator now supports working with dialogue chains.
â€” Added support for media file description translations.

@AximoBot
â€” Once again, we optimized the data extraction logic. Theoretically, this should improve the processing speed for Twitter, RSS, and Reddit data sources.
â€” For VK, we added a few additional checks for clones, as sometimes strange data would come from them.
