ðŸ”¥ Good news, everyone!

We're actively working on a couple of major updates, so we've been a bit quiet lately. However, over the past month, we've made numerous small fixes, changes, and improvements, so it's the perfect time to talk about them. Additionally, let's once more acknowledge the unjustly forgotten members of our bot army.

@download_it_bot
â€” The system now correctly re-downloads videos if they were corrupted.
â€” We slightly optimized the format list display and removed the size for small videos.

@AuxioBot
â€” Discovered unexpectedly that saving settings and choosing a voice for speech generation wasn't working properly. This has been fixed.

@ChatPolyglotBot
â€” The language selection was glitching, and we have added automatic language recognition to the list.

@voice_remover_bot / @wtsong_bot
â€” Fixed an error in processing audio in the FLAC format.

@ChatzillaBot
â€” Removed the check for premium, as there is none. You can now disable the welcome message.

@MadMediaBot
â€” If you're interested in ordering advertising or bot creation, this is the place for you. We've improved the bot's appearance, fixed many errors, and it now supports multiple languages. We've written about this before.
