**bitchat** is a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over Bluetooth mesh networks. No internet required, no servers, no phone numbers.

Traditional messaging apps depend on centralized infrastructure that can be monitored, censored, or disabled. **bitchat** creates ad-hoc communication networks using only the devices present in physical proximity. Each device acts as both client and server, automatically discovering peers and relaying messages across multiple hops to extend the network's reach.

This approach provides:
- **Censorship resistance**
- **Surveillance resistance**
- **Infrastructure independence**

The network remains functional during:
- Internet outages  
- Natural disasters  
- Protests  
- Regions with limited connectivity

> ⚠️ **Security Notice**:  
> Private messages have **not** received external security review and may contain vulnerabilities. Do **not** use for sensitive use cases, and do **not** rely on its security until it has been reviewed.  
> Public local chat (the main feature) has no security concerns.
