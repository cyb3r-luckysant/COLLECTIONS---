## 2. ❓ **What are the different types of hackers?** 
   **Answer:**  
   Hackers come in different "hats," each defined by their intent and methods:
   - 🎩 **Black Hat Hackers**: Malicious hackers who exploit systems for personal or financial gain.
   - 🕵️‍♂️ **White Hat Hackers**: Ethical hackers who identify vulnerabilities to improve security.
   - ⚖️ **Gray Hat Hackers**: Operate between black and white, sometimes without authorization but without malicious intent.
   - 🔥 **Red Hat Hackers**: Aggressively target and neutralize black hats, sometimes using questionable tactics.
   - 🔵 **Blue Hat Hackers**: Typically external testers employed to find vulnerabilities before product releases.

## 3. ❓ **What’s the difference between hacking and cracking?**
   **Answer:**  
   - 🕵️‍♂️ **Hacking**: The act of exploiting security flaws to gain access or control over systems, either for ethical or malicious purposes.
   - 🔓 **Cracking**: A subset of hacking that focuses on breaking security measures, such as cracking passwords or bypassing software protections.

## 4. ❓ **What are common tools used by hackers?**
   **Answer:**  
   Hackers use various specialized tools to carry out their activities. Some popular ones include:
   - 🕵️‍♂️ **Nmap**: A network scanner to detect devices and services on a network.
   - 🎯 **Wireshark**: A packet sniffer used for analyzing network traffic.
   - ⚙️ **Metasploit**: A tool used for developing and executing exploits against vulnerable systems.
   - 💣 **Aircrack-ng**: A suite of tools used to crack WEP and WPA wireless encryption.
   - 🛡️ **Burp Suite**: A popular tool for testing web application security, including finding vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injections.

---

## 5. ❓ **What is phishing?**  
   **Answer:**  
   Phishing is a cyber attack where hackers impersonate legitimate entities (like banks or popular services) to trick victims into providing personal information, such as usernames, passwords, and financial details.  
   - 📧 **Email phishing**: Sending deceptive emails to gain sensitive info.
   - 🔗 **Link phishing**: Using fake links that lead to fraudulent websites.

## 6. ❓ **How can I protect myself from hacking?**
   **Answer:**  
   Protecting yourself from hackers requires both good habits and security measures:
   - 🔑 **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: Avoid common passwords, and mix letters, numbers, and symbols.
   - 🛡️ **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Always enable 2FA for additional security.
   - 🔄 **Update Your Software**: Regularly update your OS and apps to patch vulnerabilities.
   - 🚫 **Avoid Suspicious Links & Downloads**: Don’t click on suspicious links, and only download files from trusted sources.
   - 🌐 **Use a VPN**: Protect your browsing activities on public networks by using a Virtual Private Network.

---

## 7. ❓ **What is a DDoS attack?**
   **Answer:**  
   A **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack involves overwhelming a website or server with excessive traffic, causing it to crash and become unavailable to legitimate users. The traffic comes from multiple sources, making it difficult to block.  
   - 🌐 **Botnets**: Often used in DDoS attacks, botnets are networks of compromised devices controlled by hackers.

---

## 8. ❓ **What is SQL injection?**  
   **Answer:**  
   **SQL injection** is a type of attack where hackers inject malicious SQL code into an application's database query, allowing them to manipulate or retrieve sensitive data.  
   - 💻 **Exploiting forms**: Often carried out through unprotected input fields like login forms or search bars.
   - 🔐 **Preventing SQLi**: Using parameterized queries and input validation is key.

---

## 9. ❓ **What is ethical hacking?**  
   **Answer:**  
   **Ethical hacking**, or **white-hat hacking**, involves testing systems to identify and fix vulnerabilities, usually with the consent of the system owner. Ethical hackers help protect systems by finding security flaws before malicious hackers can exploit them.  
   - 💼 **Penetration testing**: A form of ethical hacking where experts simulate attacks to identify weaknesses.
   - 🧑‍💻 **Bug bounty programs**: Rewards for finding vulnerabilities in software.

---

## 10. ❓ **What is penetration testing?**  
   **Answer:**  
   **Penetration testing** (or **pen testing**) is the practice of simulating real-world cyber attacks to evaluate the security of a system, application, or network. Pen testers try to exploit vulnerabilities to understand how a real hacker might infiltrate a system.  
   - 🛠️ **Tools used**: Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and others.
   - 🔍 **Scope**: Pen testers follow a predefined scope and obtain permission before testing.
